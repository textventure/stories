  ? Lost in the woods, you were startled by the sight of the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.
  : - Observe the cat.: observe_the_cat
    - Ask for directions.: ask_for_directions
    - Ignore the cat and continue walking.: walk_right

observe_the_cat:
  ? The Cat only grinned when it saw you. It look good-natured but it still had VERY long claws and a great many teeth.
  : - Treat it with respect.: treat_with_respect
    - Ask for directions.: ask_for_directions

treat_with_respect:
  “Cheshire Puss,” you began, rather timidly...:
    - Check if the cat's pleased.: cat_grin

cat_grin:
  The cat grinned a little wider.:
    - Ask for directions.: ask_for_directions

ask_for_directions:
  ? |
    You ask the cat, “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”

    “That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.
  : - “I don't much care where.”: i_dont_care_where
    - “So long as I get SOMEWHERE.”: i_get_somewhere

i_dont_care_where:
  “Then it doesn't matter which way you go,” said the Cat.:
    - Agree.: response_to_cat
    - Deny.: response_to_cat

i_get_somewhere:
  ? |
    “Oh, you're sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”:
  : - Agree.: response_to_cat
    - Deny.: response_to_cat

response_to_cat:
  "You could not deny this point, so you tried another question:":
    - “What sort of people live here?”: who_lives_here
    - “Are you mad?”: are_you_mad

are_you_mad:
  ? |
    The Cat replied, “We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.”
  : - ...: do_you_play_croquet
    - “How do you know?”: how_do_you_know
    - Give up and leave.: walk_right

how_do_you_know:
  ? |
    “To begin with,” said the Cat, “let's grant that a dog's not mad.”

    “A dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased.”

    “Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.”
  : - “I suppose so.”: do_you_play_croquet
    - “I call it purring, not growling.”: do_you_play_croquet

do_you_play_croquet:
  “Anyhoo, do you play croquet with the Queen?”:
    - “Yes.”: see_you_there
    - “No.”: if_you_go
    - “I wasn't invited.”: if_you_go

see_you_there:
  ? |
    “Well then,” said the Cat, “you'll see me there.” Then the Cat vanished.
  : - Continue walking.: walk_right

if_you_go:
  ? |
    “Well if you go,” said the Cat, “you'll see me there.” Then the Cat vanished.
  : - Continue walking.: walk_right

who_lives_here:
  ? |
    “In THAT direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives a Hatter.”

    “And in THAT direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a March Hare.”

    “Visit either you like: they're both mad.”:
  : - Take the left path.: walk_left
    - Take the right path.: walk_right

walk_left:
  ? You have not gone much farther before you came in sight of the house of the Hatter.
  : - End of chapter.: end

walk_right:
  ? You have not gone much farther before you came in sight of the house of the March Hare.
  : - End of chapter.: end
